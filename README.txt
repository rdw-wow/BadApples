Post a ticket on either download site, or a comment on WoWInterface.

If you are reporting a bug, please include directions I can follow to
reproduce the bug, whether it still happens when all other addons are
disabled, and the exact text of the related error message (if any) from 
[BugSack](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5995-BugSack.html).

If you need to contact me privately, you can send me a private message
on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.
